gnuplot for TI Graphing Calculator Users
========================================

TI calculators are commonly used for quick calculations and plotting.
However, they have many limitations compared to software running on a general-purpose personal computer,
such as the open-source program `gnuplot`_.
There are numerous advantages to learning how to use gnuplot in place of a graphing calculator.

Unfortunately, while there are many `tutorials`_ and `books`_ for gnuplot,
they do not take the perspective of someone familiar with a TI graphing calculator,
explain how to adapt to gnuplot,
nor explain where gnuplot lacks the features of a TI calculator.

This book is an attempt to rectify this gap. You can read the `pdf`_ or see the `LaTeX source code`_.

This book is still in the early stages of writing. See the ``%TODO`` comments in the LaTeX source.

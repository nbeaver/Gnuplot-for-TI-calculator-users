gnuplot for TI Graphing Calculator Users
========================================

TI calculators are commonly used for quick calculations and plotting.
However, they have many limitations compared to software running on a general-purpose personal computer,
such as the open-source program `gnuplot`_.

Unfortunately, while there are many `tutorials`_ and `books`_ for gnuplot,
they do not take the perspective of someone familiar with a TI graphing calculator,
nor discuss the differences between the two.

This is an attempt to rectify this gap.
